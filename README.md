Project completed for my first assignment in my OOP module for my Computer Science degree.
For this project I was required to create a classifier that grouped news articles based on their content.
This was done by assessing the semantic closeness of the articles using Term-Freuqency Inverese-Document-Frequecy (TF-IDF) embedding
TF-IDF would be used to form vector representations of each document, and the documents would be grouped into clusters based on their similairity
The grade achieved for this project was 28.95/30
